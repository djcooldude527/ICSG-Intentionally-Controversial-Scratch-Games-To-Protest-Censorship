## 'RATING' SYSTEM I TOTALLY DIDN'T MAKE UP ON THE SPOT
### Categories of exposure
* DE - 'Direct Exposure' to sensitive themes; It's literally being shown to your damn face
* CA - 'Centered Around A Sensitive Topic(s)' - The entire game/animation revolves around (a) sensitive topic(s) but you don't really see any of the truly bad stuff happen close-up.
* TR - 'Themes Referenced/Discussed' - Sensitive themes aren't particularly 'included' but they are referenced, discussed or suggested/hinted at.
### Themes to be exposed to
If these are used in lowercase that means they aren't that present
* ST - Sexual Themes
* DH - Dark Humor
* DP - Deeply Political (these aren't really age-ratings... They're CONTROVERSY ratings...)
* IT - Individuals Targeted (don't worry they deserve it)
* EV - Extreme Violence or terrorism (haha)
* AP - Annoying People (people we absolutely f*cking hate such as politicians)
* DU - opinions often Disagreed Upon because there are too many gullible idiots who can't see things for what they really are. For example, all the old ret*rds that voted yes for 'kids' online 'safety' bills, and 'hate' speech bills that are actually really vague because they're just a way for people in power to silence people who speak out by literally getting them ARRESTED for excersing their freedom of speech and their right to expression. I HATE MY DAMN COUNTRYYYYY
* IH - Innocent people Harmed. Do I have to say more?
* LQ - Low Quality; The game is total dogshit, with almost no effort or playtesting put into it. Lovely.
* ES - Edgy Slop; Edgy for the sake of being edgy. Even if it's an acceptable quality it's still probably downright cringe as fuck in this way.
* EC - Extreme levels of Cringe.
* HQ - super duper High Quality! Probably made in Unreal Engine 5 because that's where all the shitty AAA games that can't run on your two-grand PC on minimum graphics come from! Evolving backwards!
* HD - stylized version super realistic very accurate totally doesn't look like total dogshit such 'better artstyle' guys!
* SQ - Sequel - super cool sequel that runs at 20FPS on a good day and has the shittiest storyline ever!! I can't wait for it to come out! I sure hope it doesn't still run like shit on any modern setup that doesn't cost like ten grand a whole decade later! And EVEN BETTER: IT COSTS THE AMAZINGLY FAIR PRICE OF NINETY DOLLARS!!! YouTubers will get to enjoy it tho cuz they got fucking supercomputers made from parts that were probably given to them for free for a sponsorship two years ago! Totally didn't wait, like, a literal fucking decade for this bloated slop!
