## 'RATING' SYSTEM I TOTALLY DIDN'T MAKE UP ON THE SPOT
### Categories of exposure
* DE - 'Direct Exposure' to sensitive themes; It's literally being shown to your damn face
* CA - 'Centered Around A Sensitive Topic(s)' - The entire game/animation revolves around (a) sensitive topic(s) but you don't really see any of the truly bad stuff happen close-up.
* TR - 'Themes Referenced/Discussed' - Sensitive themes aren't particularly 'included' but they are referenced, discussed or suggested/hinted at.
### Themes to be exposed to
If these are used in lowercase that means they aren't that present
* ST - Sexual Themes
* DH - Dark Humor
* DP - Deeply Political (these aren't really age-ratings... They're CONTROVERSY ratings...)
* IT - Individuals Targeted (don't worry they deserve it)
* EV - Extreme Violence or terrorism (haha)
* AP - Annoying People (people we absolutely f*cking hate such as politicians)
* DU - opinions often Disagreed Upon because there are too many gullible idiots who can't see things for what they really are. For example, all the old ret*rds that voted yes for 'kids' online 'safety' bills, and 'hate' speech bills that are actually really vague because they're just a way for people in power to silence people who speak out by literally getting them ARRESTED for excersing their freedom of speech and their right to expression. I HATE MY DAMN COUNTRYYYYY
* IH - Innocent people Harmed. Do I have to say more?
* LQ - Low Quality; The game is total dogshit, with almost no effort or playtesting put into it. Lovely.
* ES - Edgy Slop; Edgy for the sake of being edgy. Even if it's an acceptable quality it's still probably downright cringe as fuck in this way.
* EC - Extreme levels of Cringe.

### Methods to verify your age (don't worry, this only takes a minute)
* Send us a photo of your government-issued ID
* Do a video selfie so our AI can determine your age
* This is a joke
* If you voted yes to anything Online Safety-related, please consider making a contribution to society by killing yourself in the next 24 hours. You will not be missed, and I will piss on your grave. I will then come back at midnight to finish all over your tombstone before I proceed to hit it with a sledgehammer.
