## 'RATING' SYSTEM I TOTALLY DIDN'T MAKE UP ON THE SPOT
### Levels of exposure
* DE - 'Direct Exposure' to sensitive themes; It's literally being shown to your damn face
* CA - 'Centered Around A Sensitive Topic(s)' - The entire game/animation revolves around (a) sensitive topic(s) but you don't really see any of the truly bad stuff happen close-up.
* TR - 'Themes Referenced/Discussed' - Sensitive themes aren't particularly 'included' but they are referenced, discussed or suggested/hinted at. Just CA really.
### Themes
* ST - Sexual themes
* DH - Dark humor
*
