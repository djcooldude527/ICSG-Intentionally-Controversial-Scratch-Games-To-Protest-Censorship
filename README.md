## 'RATING' SYSTEM I TOTALLY DIDN'T MAKE UP ON THE SPOT
### Categories of exposure
* DE - 'Direct Exposure' to sensitive themes; It's literally being shown to your damn face
* CA - 'Centered Around A Sensitive Topic(s)' - The entire game/animation revolves around (a) sensitive topic(s) but you don't really see any of the truly bad stuff happen close-up.
* TR - 'Themes Referenced/Discussed' - Sensitive themes aren't particularly 'included' but they are referenced, discussed or suggested/hinted at.
### Themes to be exposed to
* ST - Sexual themes
* DH - Dark humor
* DP - Deeply political (these aren't really age-ratings... They're CONTROVERSY ratings...)
* IT - Individuals targed (don't worry they deserve it)
* EV - Extreme violence or terrorism (haha)
* AP - Annoying people (people we absolutely f*cking hate such as politicians)
* DU - Opinions often disagreed upon because there are too many gullible idiots who can't see things for what they really are. For example, all the old ret*rds that voted yes for online safety bills, and 'hate' speech bills that are actually really vague because they're just a way for people in power to silence people who speak out by literally getting them ARRESTED for excersing their freedom of speech and their right to expression. I HATE MY DAMN COUNTRYYYYY
### The ratings
* EFD + EFT
  * DE-STDPIT
  * EFT: DE-STDPITAPDU
* Private Island Tycoon Lite
  * CA-STDHDP
* Shoot Albo
  * DPITEVAPDU
  * The reason I didn't include Dark Humor in the Controversy Rating for this is that this isn't humor. I genuinely want someone to do this. WE **NEED** someone to do this NOW.
